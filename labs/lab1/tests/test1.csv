# Allocate flow to dst h31 to path [r1, r4, r3]

# Check that network is reset to default state

# Comments:
# You should observe how there is no congestion in the network, and
# all links are load-balanced. In the end, you should observe how
# Flow(h11->h32) is allocated to default shortest path, since there is
# no more traffic in the network (the lies are removed correctly).
