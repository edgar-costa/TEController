## TEST 2 #####################################
## When single flow is too big ################
# Fill edge (r4, r3) to 20%

# Fill edge (r2, r3) to 20%

# Send big flow h21 -> h31

# Comments:
# You should observe how the algorithm chooses the path in the network
# that will create less congestion (even though the flow can't be
# allocated in the network without congestion). In this case, the
# chosen path is [r2, r1, r3].
