# Comments:
# f1 should be allocated in [r1, r3], but when f2 arrives, all both
# flows should move to path [r1,r2,r3], since they together don't fit
# in any other path. f3 is allocated in [r1, r2, r3] too, which is the
# default path for the flow when it arrives, and it fits in it. When
# f4 arrives, all traffic towards h30 can't be fit in any single path,
# so the congestion probability is 100%.

# Note that if we would apply ECMP on the three existing paths from r1
# to destination h30, the congestion probability would be reduced.
