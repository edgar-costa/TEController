# Comments:
# Flow(h11->h31) should be allocated in path [r1, r3]. Flow(h12->h31)
# should make Flow(h11->h31) move too to path [r1, r2, r3]. Even
# though Flow(h2->h31) would fit in the next-shortest path [r1,r4,r3],
# when applying the DAG to force this path, Flow(h11->h31) would also
# move there and create congestion.
