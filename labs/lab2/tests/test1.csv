# Comments: f1 and f2 should be allocated in [r1, r3], but when f3
# arrives, all three flows should move to path [r1,r2,r3], since they
# don't fit in any other path. f4 is allocated in [r1, r2, r3] too,
# which is the default path for the flow when it arrives, and it fits
# in it. When f5 arrives, all traffic towards h30 can't be fit in any
# single path, so the congestion probability is 100%. Therefore, the
# ECMP algorithm is activated, and it should compute the path
# combination that maximally reduces the probability.
